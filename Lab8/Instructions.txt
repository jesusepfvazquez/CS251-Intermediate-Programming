Mine Manager:

We will need to store 

(1) coordinates:
identify col and row (x,y)
neighbors 
-> make a coordinate object: it has a method that tells me the neighbor coordinates 

*We need more than the positions: 

(2) Cells: 
coords (stored maybe on a map)
-Does is have a mine? Is it flaged? Is it covered/exposed? (fields?)
-Need number of neighbor mines

For testing purposes: Random number generators
r = new Random(), r.nextint(10)

// fix seed
new Random(42)
